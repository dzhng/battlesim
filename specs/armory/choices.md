# Armory: choices

## Slice 07

- **Fade: 0.5 s, in and out.** A dropped loop fades over 0.5 s, and a new one
  ramps in over the same time (its `attack`). Why: a unit switch reads as a
  quick crossfade, well under the menu's 1.2 s bed fade, which is a
  screen-change pace. Alternative: reuse `MENU_FADE_S`, which drags on a list
  sweep. *Provisional*: slice 11 hears it.
- **Id range: open-ended, from 16 up.** The sink keys voices in a map, so the
  range needs no cap; each new show voice takes the next id. The bed (1) and
  the cue (3) sit below. Alternative: a fixed block of N ids, which adds a
  "too many loops" case that no unit has. *Sound.*
- **The bed restart clears by id.** `WebAudioSink.clear` takes an optional
  id filter, and the bed restart clears everything but show voices. Why: the
  restart has to cut the previous bed while it is still fading, and a stopped
  voice has already left the id map, so stopping slot 1 cannot reach it.
  Alternative: a second sink for show loops, which would need its own master,
  limiter and volume wiring. *Sound.*
- **Leaving the menu screen forgets the asked-for loops; mute keeps them.**
  `loading` fades them out and `other` cuts them with the rest of the menu
  mix. Returning to the menu plays nothing until a page asks again. Why: the
  loops belong to the page that asked, and that page is gone. Mute is a
  setting, so unmuting resumes what was asked for. *Sound.*
- **Readiness has one owner.** `SoundBank.prepared(name)` reports whether
  `get` can return a sound. `AppAudio` starts a loop only once its sound is
  prepared, and asks the bank for the missing ones. The bank already joins
  duplicate preparations. Alternative: a ready set in `AppAudio`, which
  duplicates the bank's own state. *Sound.*
- **Show loops ride the `units` bus with no low-pass, no reverb and no
  position.** The spec names the bus. The rest matches the bed: the sound is
  heard at the camera, not placed in a world. *Sound.*
- **Loops are keyed by sound name.** If a call names the same sound twice,
  the last entry wins. *Sound.*

## Slice 09

- **The constructor takes the unit catalog: `new ArmoryAppearances(units, fetcher?)`.**
  The spec's seam was `constructor(fetcher?)`, but a kind's art comes from
  `UnitCatalog.appearancesFor`. The catalog is the session's
  (`useSessionCatalog`), and taking it once keeps `show` to the spec's
  selection. Alternative: pass the worn appearance set into `show`, which
  pushes the kind-to-art mapping onto every caller. *Sound.*
- **`show` resolves `{ appearances, runtime }`, not the bare
  `InstalledAppearances`.** `runtime` is the selection's library as
  `RuntimeFiles` (its `catalog` and `contents`). `fieldedBattle` reads a
  unit's bundle contents through these, and they must come from the library
  that installed the art: the shared `gameRuntime` would answer from the
  wrong library. Alternative: a `runtime` getter for the newest library,
  which races a pending switch. *Sound*; slice 11 consumes it.
- **A fresh `AppearanceLibrary` per call, no narrowing method.** The loader
  is untouched, so it stays the one owner of loading, and an old selection's
  decoded art goes when its library is dropped. A narrowing method would add
  a second way to shrink a generation that only the Armory uses. *Sound.*
- **The memo keeps the newest selection's files.** It holds every file that
  the last selection to resolve read, as bytes, keyed by URL. After each
  answered call it is replaced by that call's files. The yard, the catalog
  and the template library are in every selection, so they download once,
  while the previous unit's bytes leave on the next switch. A failed or
  superseded call never replaces it, and no failed response is kept.
  Alternative: memoize only the yard's own URLs, which means asking the
  catalog which files belong to the yard. That duplicates
  `catalogLoadNames`. *Sound.*
- **A superseded call stops fetching.** Its next fetch rejects with
  AbortError, so a quick list sweep doesn't keep downloading units nobody
  will see. The call itself answers AbortError however its load ended.
  Fetches already in flight are not cancelled, because `Fetch` takes no
  signal. *Sound.*
- **The default fetcher is `countedFetch`,** so the Armory's downloads move
  the loading screen's counter as the battle's do. *Sound.*
- **The yard is the scenery appearance set, the loader's own `scenery`
  filter.** Slice 10 maps prop kinds to appearances (`propsDrawnBy`) before
  calling. *Sound.*
