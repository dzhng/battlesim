# One-renderer auto-research record

## Contract

Objective: implement the one-renderer architecture and decide whether the
shared Rust `wgpu` runtime can replace the browser TypeGPU renderer without
breaking production visuals or lifecycle behavior.

Fixed comparison: the same frozen presentation frame, canvas size, adapter,
render scale, and authored runtime assets. The browser TypeGPU renderer is the
control; the browser and native shells call the shared Rust renderer candidate.

Acceptance is architectural and behavioral, not a microbenchmark win. The
candidate must preserve battle digests/publication contracts, match the
production frame within the existing screenshot gates, and pass resize, rebuild,
surface/device-loss recovery. Complexity is measured after deleting duplicate
TypeGPU owners; a small performance regression is acceptable when the total
renderer ownership and source complexity are lower.

Cheap evaluator: focused Rust/WASM checks, then the `one-renderer` browser
scene with interleaved repeats and screenshot/accounting output. Full native
parity and repository closeout run only after all production passes are wired.

## Hypothesis queue

1. **Shared resource owners first (active):** moving native model/material,
   shadow, and fog target ownership into `renderer-core` gives both shells one
   lifetime owner without changing GPU work. Falsifier: browser-safe types cannot
   represent the existing assets or native behavior without a second graph.
2. **Pass seams before browser integration:** extracting fog, effects, post and
   overlays as input traits/records will make the native frame callable from the
   browser shell while retaining pass order. Falsifier: the seam requires DOM,
   filesystem, or platform-specific resource types in the core.
3. **Lifecycle is the complexity gate:** shared resize/rebuild/reset/device-loss
   ownership removes more duplicated state than it adds. Falsifier: either
   shell needs an independent registry or cannot return to a clean baseline.
4. **Deletion is the final win:** after parity, deleting TypeGPU runtime owners
   produces the complexity reduction. Falsifier: keeping TypeGPU as a runtime
   materially lowers maintenance without duplicating rendering ownership.

## Parameter-effect map

| Strategy | Current evidence | Effect | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standalone Rust production-shaped graph | Full frame distance 47.03; incomplete materials/shadows/fog/post | Fast diagnostic, invalid migration comparison | Reject as final architecture |
| Shared target/pipeline/depth/world owners | Native/browser compile; unchanged pass order/GPU work | Reduces duplicate allocation and attachment policy | Keep |
| Shared indexed model upload owner | Native/browser compile; queue upload seam | Establishes one model GPU lifetime owner; no measured extra draws | Keep, production integration pending |
| Shared fog-mask owner | Native/browser-safe core; same 2 optional distance passes + compose + rim | Removes native attachment/pass duplication with zero extra GPU work | Keep |
| Shared effects/post owners | Native/browser-safe resource and ordered fullscreen/instanced draws | Removes native pass/resource duplication; asset decoding remains shell-owned | Keep |
| Shared target lifecycle owner | Atomic target swap plus generation counter | Makes resize invalidation one contract with no extra GPU passes | Keep |
| Shared fog compute pipeline owner | Four exported compute bindings and stable dispatch labels/order | Removes pipeline/dispatch drift; presentation upload and bind groups stay shell-owned | Keep |
| Browser TypeGPU as permanent second renderer | Two pass/resource graphs | Preserves a known control at the cost of permanent duplication | Reject after parity |

## Handoff

Incumbent: `d5c8d7fc6` plus the shared browser-owner commits on PR #16.
Active task: connect production presentation/environment/fog/overlay records to
the browser groups, then close device-loss recovery. Regression set:
renderer-core/native-client WASM checks, presentation tests, and the interleaved
one-renderer scene. The latest rebuilt scene passes all eleven rows and executes
the fetched mesh through exported model prepass and opaque passes. Next test:
replace placeholder environment/fog records with a frozen presentation frame.
