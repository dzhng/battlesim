# C06: sim scale passes

**Depends on:** C05 (conditional on S1 and C05). **Kind:** slice.

## Question
Do the sim's static-occluder and nav costs fit the budget at city scale?

## Contract it unlocks
Only the fixes S1 or C05 flag, one commit each, likely:
- (a) `OcclusionGrid::refresh` rebuilds only the dirty cells of the props that changed;
- (b) nav rebuilds only the cells under the changed bodies (`movement/mod.rs:208-213`).

**Closes without code if the numbers are under budget.**

This pass handles local active-work costs after G0's full-extent storage/export architecture is proven. Dirty rebuilds cannot fix dense permanent allocations. Any required terrain/navigation/foliage representation change gets its own prerequisite slice at G0; do not hide it inside this pass.

## API seam
`sim::visibility`, `sim::navigation`, `sim::movement`.

## What the human can run or see
`city_report` rows before and after.

## Verification
- Property tests: incremental equals a full rebuild, byte for byte.
- Village and city digests unchanged.
- Instructions retired; `village_report --compare main` as a cross-check (0 battles if digests match).

## Delegated to the implementer
Dirty-region bookkeeping. Anything else you have to decide is a spec gap: record it in `../choices.md` under this slice.

## Must stay green
All digests.

## Feedback that would change this slice
A measured rebuild bottleneck selects a focused incremental owner; changed outcomes invalidate this performance-only pass.

## Outcome — termination pass; scale still open

A soldier's rejoin search sampled farther along a corridor until the candidate
left local reach. The sampler clamps at the endpoint, so a blocked endpoint
inside local reach could be tested forever. The search now stops after exhausting
the remaining corridor; the existing fallback can then run. The red/green
regression is bounded by its predicate and proves search exhaustion without
hanging the harness. Successful candidate order is unchanged.

Fine routes now ask the existing boolean walkability query; bridges, water,
steep ground and bounds agree with the full surface query. This simplification
produced no measured speedup and does not substantiate a fine-routing bottleneck.
Matched city early/late digests and [system costs](../scale-lane.md#c06-termination-checkpoint)
remain the scale lane's evidence. C06 is still open against the tick budget.
