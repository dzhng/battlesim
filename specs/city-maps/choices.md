# city-maps choices ledger

Implementation decisions not already settled by the user or plan. Each entry names its gap, consequence, verdict and confidence; delegated experiment limits are recorded in the owning evidence instead.

## Sound

### Systems proofs may unlock their production contract before complete art acceptance

**When:** S0 / systems-scope checkpoint, 2026-09-30.

**Choice:** A physical/resource contract can enter production after its own frozen proof passes while complete G0 and released appearance remain open. For example, a new terrain representation must reproduce the original heights/rays and fit full-size memory limits before simulation consumers use it; missing tower art does not block that code proof. The alternative would wait for finished models before any nonvisual implementation, so the requested specialist handoff could never be reached.

**Gap:** The original G0 bundled physical feasibility with source exports and visual frame approval. The user then explicitly deferred 3D design/modeling until systems implementation finishes.

**Reach:** Every mixed slice carries two evidence responsibilities: implemented systems and pending specialist acceptance. This does not mark the whole slice/release complete, waive resource failures or certify prototype art.

**Verdict:** Sound — respects the new execution order while keeping each original final requirement and a concrete parity/resource gate.

**Confidence:** High.

## SA2 sparse navigation proof

### Keep the original planner as an evidence oracle, never a runtime fallback

- **When:** SA2 representation correction.
- **Choice:** freeze the original planner under the proof assets and compile it only in the matched proof example. When a tank asks for a route, production uses the one spatial NavGrid; the example independently runs the frozen planner on identical safe inputs and compares its actual answer. A second runtime backend would split route ownership and hide scale failures on small maps.
- **Gap:** the slice required frozen equivalence evidence but delegated its executable form.
- **Reach:** future search corrections inherit an original-winner oracle without retaining dense production allocations.
- **Verdict:** sound. This keeps evidence reproducible and leaves one planner owner.
- **Confidence:** high.

### Use sufficient geometric certificates without changing route scheduling

- **When:** SA2 representation correction.
- **Choice:** an entirely closed row or column between the snapped endpoints proves NoRoute without flooding one map half. A clear, uniform endpoint rectangle can produce the same single smoothed goal as the original planner; faster terrain elsewhere vetoes that shortcut for Fastest. If either certificate cannot prove its case, the original A* priority, neighbour order, parent updates and sampled smoothing run. A broad stronger heuristic was tested and rejected after changing an original waypoint.
- **Gap:** exact search corrections were delegated, but neither a stronger priority nor approximate routes were authorized.
- **Reach:** these certificates cover specific geometric facts, not general city routing. The safe original-winner corpus and village trace match; long geometry and full native/wasm route parity remain proof obligations before full SA2 unlock.
- **Verdict:** sound within the recorded proof scope. The bridge failure remains red instead of treating a few cheap routes as a universal work bound.
- **Confidence:** medium.

### Representation discretion and rejected arms

The delegated storage choice is implicit open/edge cells with sparse exact exceptions, 32-cell clearance tiles with the inherited 16 m cap and derived 8-cell halo, and 32-cell visited scratch tiles. Retained capacities and both-side/rebuild overlap remain part of admission. Navigation's read-only storage/expansion diagnostics do not enter digests or publication. Per-cell visited hashes were replaced after their measured heap cost. A one-active-entry heap was rejected after 2.6% fewer instructions cost 20% more heap; the original heap remains. Asynchronous route jobs were documented only as an architecture candidate because changing the movement-start tick is a behavior decision. No new game rule or visual design was selected.
