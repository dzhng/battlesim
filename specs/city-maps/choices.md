Implementation decisions not already settled by the user or plan. Each entry names its gap, consequence, verdict and confidence; delegated experiment limits are recorded in the owning evidence instead.

## Sound

### Public height queries use samples independently of drawing triangles

**When:** SA1 terrain/export pass, 2026-09-30.

**Choice:** A browser querying the riverbed reads the simulation's compact height samples, even when drawing coalesces a large surrounding flat field into two triangles. The sample export describes its dimensions and present pages; omitted pages mean exactly zero height. Fog and grass share one GPU copy of those samples. The alternative would recover a rectangular height grid from drawing vertices, which stops working once equivalent flat triangles are coalesced.

**Gap:** SA1 required an exact compact public surface but left the browser encoding and shared GPU lifetime unspecified.

**Reach:** Drawing can change equivalent triangle layout without changing height lookup. Consumers must use the sampled-surface descriptor rather than assume vertices are row-major grid samples. The combined directory/height buffer keeps paging inside the existing device binding budget.

**Verdict:** Sound — the frozen query oracle and real Metal readback prove one physical surface across the consumer cutover; no approximate resampling or second simulation world is introduced.

**Confidence:** High.

### Systems proofs may unlock their production contract before complete art acceptance

**When:** S0 / systems-scope checkpoint, 2026-09-30.

**Choice:** A physical/resource contract can enter production after its own frozen proof passes while complete G0 and released appearance remain open. For example, a new terrain representation must reproduce the original heights/rays and fit full-size memory limits before simulation consumers use it; missing tower art does not block that code proof. The alternative would wait for finished models before any nonvisual implementation, so the requested specialist handoff could never be reached.

**Gap:** The original G0 bundled physical feasibility with source exports and visual frame approval. The user then explicitly deferred 3D design/modeling until systems implementation finishes.

**Reach:** Every mixed slice carries two evidence responsibilities: implemented systems and pending specialist acceptance. This does not mark the whole slice/release complete, waive resource failures or certify prototype art.

**Verdict:** Sound — respects the new execution order while keeping each original final requirement and a concrete parity/resource gate.

**Confidence:** High.

### Observation visibility shares the ground stream's side and epoch

**When:** SA4, 2026-09-30.

**Choice:** Switching from blue to red opens one new observation stream for both visibility and learned ground. The epoch is the number naming that stream; visibility keeps its own exact revision within it. A red fog snapshot therefore cannot be paired with blue's learned ground. The unbuilt alternative would maintain separate stream identities and coordinate their completion before a frame could be exposed.

**Gap:** The slice required explicit identity and no mixed epochs without choosing whether visibility should introduce a separate stream.

**Reach:** Future publication fields that depend on a consumer baseline should join this stream identity. Ground's payload and learning revisions retain their existing contract; transport revisions do not change battle digests.

**Verdict:** Sound — reuses the existing side/resynchronization owner and avoids a second coordination state machine.

**Confidence:** High.

### Return obsolete side-view credits without exposing their frames

**When:** SA4, 2026-09-30.

**Choice:** Blue's first frame arrives and the user switches the diagnostic view to red while a second blue frame is already in flight. The client records the requested side and invalidates its current epoch, returns that second frame's buffer as credit, and counts its returned tick toward an outstanding advance. It exposes the next red snapshot only when both visibility and learned ground belong to the new epoch. The unbuilt alternative would queue the requested view change until every old frame had been shown, leaving the old view visible longer.

**Gap:** The plan required unchanged authority tick/backpressure semantics and no mixed side views but did not specify the handling of an already-completed old-side frame. The integrating agent explicitly accepted discarding those stale view records while returning their credits.

**Reach:** A side switch is a diagnostic view reset, not ordinary tick coalescing. The authority still completes every tick in order, and an advance cannot stall merely because its final buffer became obsolete after the switch. Race regressions before and after the first callback pin both the side filtering and advance completion.

**Verdict:** Sound — follows the existing immediate learned-ground invalidation and preserves authority progress without introducing a deferred-switch queue.

**Confidence:** High.

### Publish changed ground as exact tile runs

**When:** SA3 / SA4 transport seam, 2026-09-30.

**Choice:** When a side learns a whole cleared tile, send one record saying which tile, which local cells and their exact ground bytes. The receiver keeps those bytes as a short run. When neighboring cells differ, their runs remain separate and a busy page uses dense bytes. A run never includes a cell whose learning stamp is outside the requested cursor. Local tile rows reconstruct global indices using the map width, so neither a row crossing nor a far map corner loses its address.

**Gap:** Sparse indexes alone leave a full learned snapshot larger than wasm can address. At 18 km, the original collected cell records and float publication exceed the experiment ceiling before the client receives them. The snapshot seam needed a shape that preserves knowledge without first enumerating every cell into a second array.

**Reach:** The native iterator, publication encoding, decoder and learned receiver change together. Frozen tests expand small outputs to canonical original tile/local order; production consumers query pages or consume runs directly. The transport carries the same epoch, side and cursor semantics.

**Verdict:** Sound — the run encoding is lossless and the focused seam tests preserve exact values, order, hidden edits and side replacement. Whole-map admission and arbitrary-entropy bounds still require executed resource evidence.

**Confidence:** High for correctness; resource acceptance remains pending.

### Learned cells persist while the GPU caches exact sampling regions

**When:** SA3, 2026-09-30.

**Choice:** Keep every learned cell in lossless CPU pages and reuse one bounded GPU cache for each admitted draw region. Exact uniform tiles live as packed directory words; varying tiles use filtered texture pages with their full halo. The rejected whole-known atlas could exceed two gigabytes, and the measured bounded atlas that materialized even uniform pages uploaded 2.15 GB per overview frame.

**Gap:** The original world-sized scar texture exceeds the actual device limit at each required map size; sparse JavaScript alone cannot fix that capability.

**Reach:** Camera residency cannot evict gameplay knowledge or turn known marks into zero. Draw batches submit before overwriting their shared cache. Foliage clearing and tree suppression query the same learned owner. Future nonuniform workloads must remain exact and fit the admitted region, not silently approximate.

**Verdict:** Sound ownership and source correction, supported by exact sampling tests and real Metal allocation/disposal evidence. The initial uniform directory arm was slow (373 ms at the 18 km overview); the common-word correction below resolves that measured uniform workload. Mixed/fragmented throughput stays open. Arbitrary-entropy and full native overlap remain separate admission evidence.

**Confidence:** High for the proved values/lifetime; full performance and production pixel acceptance remain open.
## SA2 sparse navigation proof

### Keep the original planner as an evidence oracle, never a runtime fallback

- **When:** SA2 representation correction.
- **Choice:** freeze the original planner under the proof assets and compile it only in the matched proof example. When a tank asks for a route, production uses the one spatial NavGrid; the example independently runs the frozen planner on identical safe inputs and compares its actual answer. A second runtime backend would split route ownership and hide scale failures on small maps.
- **Gap:** the slice required frozen equivalence evidence but delegated its executable form.
- **Reach:** future search corrections inherit an original-winner oracle without retaining dense production allocations.
- **Verdict:** sound. This keeps evidence reproducible and leaves one planner owner.
- **Confidence:** high.

### Use sufficient geometric certificates without changing route scheduling

- **When:** SA2 representation correction.
- **Choice:** an entirely closed row or column between the snapped endpoints proves NoRoute without flooding one map half. A clear, uniform endpoint rectangle can produce the same single smoothed goal as the original planner; faster terrain elsewhere vetoes that shortcut for Fastest. If either certificate cannot prove its case, the original A* priority, neighbour order, parent updates and sampled smoothing run. A broad stronger heuristic was tested and rejected after changing an original waypoint.
- **Gap:** exact search corrections were delegated, but neither a stronger priority nor approximate routes were authorized.
- **Reach:** these certificates cover specific geometric facts, not general city routing. The safe original-winner corpus and village trace match; long geometry and full native/wasm route parity remain proof obligations before full SA2 unlock.
- **Verdict:** sound within the recorded proof scope. The bridge failure remains red instead of treating a few cheap routes as a universal work bound.
- **Confidence:** medium.

### Representation discretion and rejected arms

The delegated storage choice is implicit open/edge cells with sparse exact exceptions, 32-cell clearance tiles with the inherited 16 m cap and derived 8-cell halo, and 32-cell visited scratch tiles. Retained capacities and both-side/rebuild overlap remain part of admission. Navigation's read-only storage/expansion diagnostics do not enter digests or publication. Per-cell visited hashes were replaced after their measured heap cost. A one-active-entry heap was rejected after 2.6% fewer instructions cost 20% more heap; the original heap remains. Asynchronous route jobs were documented only as an architecture candidate because changing the movement-start tick is a behavior decision. No new game rule or visual design was selected.


## Sound: ground publication admission and recovery

### Admit one complete record and fail explicitly when it cannot fit

**When:** SA3 integrated transport checkpoint, 2026-09-30.

**Choice:** A reconnect that learns all uniform Large ground and finest-grid fog sends one complete record within a provisional 64 MiB allowance. Before allocating output, the publisher adds every group and payload with checked arithmetic. A busier record exceeding that allowance fails visibly; it cannot drop distant cells or publish a partial observation. The alternative would fragment a record across several credits and retain a separate partially reconstructed observation state.

**Gap:** The run seam removed giant cell staging but did not select atomic-record admission or error behavior for higher-entropy snapshots.

**Reach:** Worker callers now receive a publication error, and C07 must measure/ratify actual active and high-entropy workloads. The current bound is derived from two approximately 20.25 MB payloads, not universal world admission. Fragmentation would need its own measured protocol change if actual required workloads fail.

**Verdict:** Sound as a provisional codec allowance — it has checked pre-allocation rejection and preserves the previous record/cursors on that rejection. Full-size overlap and workload acceptance stay explicit open gates.

**Confidence:** Medium.

### Validate paired baselines before committing, and make receiver failure terminal

**When:** SA3 integrated transport checkpoint, 2026-09-30.

**Choice:** A record with valid new fog but a wrong ground baseline is rejected before either decoder cursor moves. If decoding/application or the authority fails at runtime, every pending command, advance and replay promise rejects and held/incoming buffers return once. Later status messages cannot restart this client. The user starts a new client to recover. The alternative would retry/resynchronize automatically while retaining partly applied state and unresolved requests.

**Gap:** Independent review exposed a paired-cursor transaction bug and an existing failure path that settled only startup, leaving producer credits and runtime requests stranded.

**Reach:** Consumers cannot hang behind a failed publication or expose fog from a rejected ground record. Ground revisions may stay unchanged while fog advances. Automatic recovery is not implied by the protocol.

**Verdict:** Sound — the failing production decoder/worker-edge scenarios now prove baseline retention, explicit rejection and exactly-once credit return; no retry state machine is added.

**Confidence:** High.

### Cache an exact common word with complete exceptions

**When:** SA3 follow-up, 2026-09-30.

**Choice:** The learned receiver maintains page classification metadata. GPU misses inside an admitted cache return its exact common uniform word; every differing page or zero hole is explicitly represented. When the complete exception set fits the same bounded GPU pool, one global cache suffices. Larger sets use the existing bounded regional path. A 158 KB maximum tile-occupancy bitset removes first-page arrivals in constant work and enumerates missing tiles without copying/sorting all retained IDs. It is metadata, not dense ground/clearing values.

**Gap:** Exact uniform per-tile words still rebuilt 40 MB of directory data in each 18 km overview, taking 373 ms. A single missing tile also revealed whole-map temporary sorting in the first exception enumerator.

**Reach:** Defaults are valid only within cache bounds; clearing projection and partial-edge validity remain exact. Near-uniform learned maps can retain local nonuniform scars without materializing the common value as texture pages. Fragmented workloads retain their separate resource/frame gate.

**Verdict:** Sound common-word correction, with actual 18 km warm overview at 3.03 ms complete and zero repeated uploads. The bitset choice was explicitly admitted as per-tile metadata by the integrating owner and replaces a more complex interval-tree candidate. Full mixed/fragmented/native pressure and pixel acceptance remain open.

**Confidence:** High on the proved parity/lifetime; broader workload throughput remains under measurement.
### Physical catalogue identity uses canonical named records and SHA256

**When:** C00, 2026-09-30.

**Choice:** Sort templates, parts, edges, entrances and declared joins by stable names, normalize signed zero, then SHA256 the physical template array. Materialized named records use that same ordering. Category, family and missing physical facts affect this identity; appearance and source readiness have no hashed field. Height and floor count derive from their authoritative facts instead of separate counters.

**Gap:** C00 required canonical physical identity without choosing its encoding, ordering or digest algorithm. The integrating root explicitly kept status outside physical identity.

**Reach:** Renaming a physical reference or adding formerly unknown physical data creates a new catalogue identity. A materials/LOD/readiness change does not. `sha2` adds a standard hashing dependency; the simulation's state digest is not repurposed as an external content identity.

**Verdict:** Sound — one typed physical owner, verified reload, and native/wasm byte-value parity without art in battle data.

**Confidence:** High.

### Missing source facts remain optional, with an explicit completeness boundary

**When:** C00, 2026-09-30.

**Choice:** Preserve the existing house boxes while leaving absent floors, entrances and bay patterns unresolved. `require_complete()` checks those facts and complete face coverage before a dependent consumer selects them. Neither house.py trim/windows nor the old capacity-driven slots supplies invented physical metadata. Complete labelled API fixtures prove the schema separately; physical completeness does not certify source fit or art.

**Gap:** The existing owner contains only boxes and old slots. C00's required future metadata has no authoritative source yet. The integrating root approved explicit absence and deferred fit rather than inferred floors or source-ready flags.

**Reach:** C01 may preserve current slots over exact shells; C40/C53/fit consumers must reject unresolved facts. Real-source bay/floor/entrance additions change physical identity. Source readiness remains provenance/evidence outside that identity.

**Verdict:** Sound — carries known facts without changing gameplay or fabricating release coverage.

**Confidence:** High.

### Supported joins pair equal vertical envelopes; bay work has a cumulative allowance

**When:** C00 review, 2026-09-30.

**Choice:** Keep arbitrary oriented box parts and independent elevations. A declared internal join must match span, opposing normals and equal base/top; unequal-height joins are rejected until a vertical exposure contract is proved. Z-disjoint boxes cannot hide each other's facades. Bay lattices emit points strictly inside their spans, and at most 65,536 positions may be materialized across one descriptor, checked before any bay vector allocation.

**Gap:** Exposed edges had one full-height boolean. The first compound incorrectly hid a taller part's upper wall, and finite tiny pitch could request enormous allocation. The root approved rejecting the unproved join and the explicit 65,536 technical allowance.

**Reach:** Coordinate payload is bounded to 1 MiB per materialized descriptor; this is not catalogue/world residency admission or a source dimension. A nominal 3 m lattice around an 18 km square fits. Actual source compliance with the ~3 m policy, external terrace capabilities, overlap allowances and unequal-height fitted joins remain S2/S5/C13 evidence responsibilities. The rejected arm retains its original data, output and source identity.

**Verdict:** Sound — the smallest proved join contract keeps independent primitive geometry, and bounded failure prevents accidental source profiles from exhausting memory.

**Confidence:** High for the supported contract; real-source join coverage remains unproved.

### Lossless template numbers use raw-token parsing without changing scenario parsing

**When:** C00 preservation proof, 2026-09-30.

**Choice:** Parse template numeric tokens with Rust's correctly rounded f64 reader, using JSON's raw-value facility only on template fields. Encode ordinary JSON numbers. Avoid global float-reader features that would also change existing scenario parsing.

**Gap:** The default parser rounded `40.000000000168804` by one ULP, so a canonical physical catalogue could not verify its own hash after reload.

**Reach:** Template/source and materialized numeric records retain exact f64 values across native/wasm JSON boundaries. The private numeric codec and `raw_value` feature are necessary maintenance surface; they do not establish a second descriptor format. Original complete observation/digest replay remains green.

**Verdict:** Sound — fixes the measured identity failure at its owner without moving existing battle inputs.

**Confidence:** High.

### Geometry admission is relative; floating point lattices must remain representable

**When:** C00 numeric review, 2026-09-30.

**Choice:** Compare joins and facade coverage after subtracting part centres, with separate height-based allowance for vertical arithmetic roundoff. When both parts move a very large distance from the origin, that shared offset cannot become permission for a one-metre gap or disjoint storeys. Bay indices must be distinct exact f64 integers; bounded checks then require every computed point to advance strictly inside its span, in source coordinates and again after placement, before allocating any bay vector.

**Gap:** The count allowance bounded memory but not numeric representability. The first comparison allowance also used absolute XY magnitude for vertical equality. A tiny pitch emitted repeated points and points on boundaries; a common coordinate shift admitted invalid joins.

**Reach:** A source or placement too precise for its numeric frame fails deterministically rather than publishing altered physical geometry. There is no arbitrary metre, minimum-pitch or world-origin restriction. The integer ceiling is f64's exact consecutive-integer range, and checks iterate only the already bounded descriptor count. Common offsets that preserve representable geometry remain legal. Valid physical identity and emitted coordinates are unchanged; rejected inputs and their original outputs retain separate evidence.

**Verdict:** Sound — numeric admission now enforces the promised geometry rather than treating finiteness and allocation size as sufficient.

**Confidence:** High.


### Learned ground visits edited truth and newly visible tiles

**When:** SA3 native learning work, 2026-09-30.

**Choice:** Truth keeps one latest-edit entry per touched tile, including unsealed
dirty tiles. Side knowledge keeps previous visibility words and the source cursor.
Changed truth and newly visible ground select exact learning candidates; broad reveal
walks occupied tiles instead of allocating a world-sized candidate list. Fully visible
pages may share immutable truth after exact value/stamp comparison.

**Gap:** Sparse storage fit, but stable full visibility still scanned millions of fog
cells and an initial uniform learning pass expanded 324 million cells. The bounded
index trades memory for changed-work lookup; previous visibility costs one bit per fog
cell and is transport-independent.

**Reach:** Both hints are outside the battle digest. Hidden changes do not modify a
learned page; unchanged values receive no new stamp. Fractional grid partitioning,
unsealed stimuli and partial edge holes are checked against the original semantics.
The [evidence](assets/ground-learning-work/README.md) passes uniform native recurring
work at fixed extents and preserves original observations/digests. Full entropy, broad
churn, active Battle and browser/GPU acceptance remain separate.

**Verdict:** Sound for the proved learning owner; no rule, wire-schema or extent change.

**Confidence:** High for exact values and the focused recurring-work bound; complete
resource/frame admission remains open.

## SA2 exact search work

### Supply optional cost bounds without creating another route owner

- **When:** SA2 search pruning and lookup pass.
- **Choice:** when a tank approaches a narrow crossing, try a few monotone walks through its opening and check every step against the same footprint, crossing and cost rules as A*. A successful walk supplies only a cost ceiling; it never becomes the returned route. Opening size and candidate-count allowances limit this optional preparation, and failure continues the original planner. Faster terrain uses conservative all-cell and whole-rectangle discounts instead of a persistent second routing graph. The alternative would maintain another planner or terrain potential cache just to construct the bounds.
- **Gap:** the plan required feasible upper bounds and admissible lower bounds but did not choose their discovery or storage.
- **Reach:** navigation gains no new route API, retained cache, tick scheduler or failure reason. These bounds can be loose or unavailable on general maps; they do not establish the still-open full-size work gate.
- **Verdict:** sound within the recorded proof scope — one owner still chooses the route, and optional proof limits cannot reject a requested route.
- **Confidence:** medium.

### Reuse a certified flat neighbourhood instead of retaining another cache

- **When:** SA2 search pruning and lookup pass.
- **Choice:** far from conservative surface/body regions and temporary traffic, certify the current cell and all eight neighbours as the existing implicit flat cells. Their footprint, crossing and cost answers can then be reused for that one expansion. Near a region or map edge the normal queries run. The alternative would keep per-goal or per-mover cost/heuristic arrays whose residency and invalidation would become another owner.
- **Gap:** lookup reuse was delegated, but the spec did not choose a cache or a geometric certificate.
- **Reach:** the certificate inherits the conservative region contract and exact cost arithmetic, adds no retained residency and leaves future map producers responsible for complete region coverage.
- **Verdict:** sound — reduces repeated queries without changing parent ordering or introducing another state lifetime.
- **Confidence:** high.


### Physical materialization uses one portable math evaluator

**When:** C00/S6 canonical-runtime proof, 2026-09-30.

**Choice:** Physical template materialization and admission use `libm=0.2.16` with
default architecture features disabled for sin/cos and facade norms. Keep one software
implementation for frame/local rotations and the geometry predicates they feed.

**Gap:** A wider placement corpus exposed seven exact native/wasm normal mismatches.
Host math's permitted platform precision cannot define canonical generated geometry.
The [rejected and corrected receipts](assets/template-geometry/runtime-rotation/README.md)
retain separate source/output identities, and the original small records remain frozen.

**Reach:** Descriptor facts and their catalogue hashes retain the same identity. Derived
values at the failing angles adopt the shared software result; complete map identity and
generator provenance must capture generated bytes. Simulation arithmetic and ordinary
scenario parsing are unchanged. Full S6 generation coverage and preexisting whole-battle
cross-runtime numerical differences are separate obligations.

**Verdict:** Sound — a narrowly owned numerical correction establishes the required
canonical seam without changing physical dimensions or adding a second geometry format.

**Confidence:** High for the checked native/wasm evaluator and complete finite corpus;
future dependency or algorithm changes require fresh canonical-output evidence.


## C02 — reject nonfinite map resolution before grid construction

**When:** per-map fog ownership pass.

**The choice.** A map asks for an infinite fog cell. The world refuses it by the map field's name before dividing the map into foliage and visibility cells. A merely positive check permits infinity and later reaches arithmetic overflow in the visibility grid.

**The gap.** C02 specifies ownership and required input, but leaves numeric admission implicit.

**The reach.** Every Battle and public WorldView uses the same admission; future generated maps must supply a finite positive resolution. This sets no minimum resolution or release performance promise.

**Verdict: sound.** The outer Battle regression falsifies the weaker check, and valid resolutions still reach the same common owners.

**Confidence: high.** Invalid geometry should fail at its input boundary with an actionable name.

## C01 — one placed building across physical states

### Keep authored facts separate from the current live integrity owner

**Choice:** A compound building collapses and leaves two weaker shells. Its immutable building ID still names the authored template, while its live parts share one fresh integrity owner. A removed original ID has no live owner or HP. Historical keys remain private to remembered knowledge and orders. The alternative would make the weaker remains inherit an already exhausted damage key or make an obsolete body appear live.

**Gap:** C01 chose one owner but did not specify destroyable-remains chains or owner lifetimes.

**Reach:** Initial associations and the existing immediate replacement links establish each state's membership. Source ancestry is copied at creation for every authored prop; genuinely dynamic bodies retain no source. Browser appearance lookup consumes that source without reconstructing chains. Immutable map/classification/catalogue identity remains in scenario_digest; nonidentity mutable associations are hashed and extra physical seat/eye facts get a cached fingerprint. Original implicit-box digests remain exact, without a family-name compatibility branch.

**Verdict:** sound. **Confidence:** high for the frozen singleton chains, compound chains and authored/dynamic distinction; future composite motion is not admitted.

### A blast damages one structure by its strongest part contribution

**Choice:** An explosion beside a wing also reaches the main house. The house takes the stronger contribution once, rather than summing both physical boxes. A terminal transition replaces every part together; a side that sees any part learns all replacements in the same observation. A wholly hidden side keeps its previous knowledge until reveal.

**Gap:** The aggregate plan did not select how multiple parts contribute to one blast or define partial visibility at collapse.

**Reach:** Direct hits and blast results resolve through the same integrity owner. This extends the singleton rule without increasing damage just because an author divided a house into more boxes.

**Verdict:** sound. **Confidence:** high; unequal-distance damage and partial/hidden reveal regressions distinguish the alternatives.

### Preserve physical exposed spans through seating and sensing

**Choice:** Soldiers on a stepped exterior face keep their actual edge ordinal. Their sensing eyes average within that held edge, so two east-facing spans cannot average through the wing's interior. Materialized geometry carries its exact part-local interval alongside world spans; admission checks that they agree. Generic seating uses the part frame and local interval once.

**Gap:** C01 required exposed seats but did not choose eye grouping or settle the arithmetic needed to preserve rotated singleton seats.

**Reach:** Existing capacity and seats remain exact. Partial faces gain no invented bay spacing. Approach, entry and shots inspect all physical parts; a shot leaving its occupied owner skips the whole current state.

**Verdict:** sound. **Confidence:** high for frozen singleton seats/eyes and asymmetric stepped geometry; new band/cap mechanics remain C40.

### Admit only capabilities that the placed physical owner can perform

**Choice:** Authored building parts must be immovable until motion can transform an entire compound. Garrison bodies require the explicit aggregate and at least one exposed span. Ordinary movable props still use their existing movement path.

**Gap:** The schema otherwise permits a one-prop shove to tear a placed compound apart, or a garrison with no legal seat/eye.

**Reach:** Admission reads body capabilities, not kind names or invented source dimensions. Unknown floors, doors and bays are permitted for prototype geometry but do not become complete source facts.

**Verdict:** sound. **Confidence:** high for current authored capabilities and rejection proofs; composite motion remains separate work.

### Cut over the exact public ID representation with its readers

**Choice:** All physical prop IDs, optional replacement/building/live-owner/source IDs and garrison IDs use the established pair of 16-bit limbs. Public building rows contain metadata and named part references to the existing physical prop export, without a second geometry table.

**Gap:** The old scalar prop and garrison fields lost integer identity beyond float32's exact range; C01 delegated the public owner/export representation.

**Reach:** All consumers switch together. The stream epoch, tick, credits and ground/fog semantics stay in their existing transport owner. Original animation words and physical columns remain frozen; only the declared identity columns normalize.

**Verdict:** sound. **Confidence:** high for production pack/decoder wide-ID and full observation oracles; integrated visual scenes remain a closeout gate.

### Author existing boxes at the producer boundary, with unresolved source facts

**Choice:** Fixtures, endurance and analytic test preparation explicitly use the shared solid-box physical constructor. Current physical dimensions and IDs remain exact. Prototype category/family labels provide deterministic eligibility metadata, while missing floors, entrances and bays stay absent. The world does not silently convert ordinary props.

**Gap:** Current source art does not establish the complete reusable physical catalogue or accepted regional classification.

**Reach:** Sim consumes trusted final placed geometry and validates internal geometry/ID consistency. Verification against the pinned catalogue belongs to C09/C13/C32 preparation. Actual source/category acceptance will produce its own physical identity later; no art binding or design readiness is fabricated.

**Verdict:** sound within the nonvisual systems scope. **Confidence:** medium for provisional classification; complete template/source/art G0 remains open.

### Check saved geometry in its actual world-coordinate precision

**Choice:** A valid template placed kilometres from the origin can have world endpoints emitted in a different transform operation order from part-local verification. Saved interval/span admission allows four coordinate ULPs plus local rotation roundoff; bay collinearity is checked by projecting back in world coordinates. Source catalogue joins keep their stricter translation-invariant contract.

**Gap:** C01 needed to reject contradictory saved local/world intervals without rejecting valid owner-emitted geometry. A positive 12/15 km placement exposed an overstrict relative-dot check.

**Reach:** The materialized record remains the one physical owner; validation does not change its coordinates. Prototype source facts are still subject to C00 representability and cumulative bay admission before allocation.

**Verdict:** sound for the admitted saved-geometry seam. **Confidence:** medium; the labelled positive/contradictory pair proves this rounding arm, while catalogue-versus-placement provenance verification remains a separate preparation gate.

### Make the physical materializer and loader share representability admission

**Choice:** A local rotated part placed at an enormous finite yaw can lose its local angle when the final yaw is added, while its composed edge normals keep that rotation. The materializer checks its final record through the same admission as the loader and rejects the contradictory primitive pose by name.

**Gap:** Finite input alone does not ensure that one world-yaw box can express the composed physical geometry; review found a successful producer output that its consumer rejected.

**Reach:** No angle normalization or simulation math changes. The original canonical runtime corpus and frozen fixture records remain intact. Bounded bay allocation still precedes this final consistency check; complete source fit remains separate.

**Verdict:** sound. **Confidence:** high for the public materialize-to-WorldView red/green arm and unchanged canonical corpus.

### Keep existing capacity across physical directional groups

**Choice:** Exposed normals are assigned to the nearest cardinal direction of the placed building frame. Existing capacity is shared across nonempty groups, with remaining seats assigned by total exposed length; seats then sample those physical intervals in deterministic group/edge order. Each seat retains its edge for sensing.

**Gap:** Multiple differently oriented parts no longer provide exactly one box face per original facade direction, while C40's new band and capacity policy is explicitly deferred.

**Reach:** The original full box retains its exact seats and four eyes. Compound proofs cover unequal spans and stepped exterior faces. Arbitrarily rotated parts at directional quantization ties still require wider paired battle-runtime evidence under S6; canonical materialization alone does not establish that simulation claim.

**Verdict:** sound within this physical systems proof. **Confidence:** medium for unrestricted rotated compounds; C40 and full S6 runtime admission remain separate gates.

### Resolve holdable remains and observed extents from current physical parts

**Choice:** A damaged but still holdable compound uses its current members and the world's immutable authored-source association to reach the original exposed-edge records. Its next terminal transition releases the one garrison once. The observed footprint is the current members' tight envelope in the immutable building orientation, measured about a live pivot; existing ring/ruler consumers use its bounding radius.

**Gap:** Review found that authored part IDs no longer existed after replacement, leaving an admitted garrison with empty seats, and that an owner-part-only footprint omitted the wing.

**Reach:** No second geometry or lineage owner, new visual style or schema column is added. Original singleton observations and animation words remain exact. Public static picking still addresses the immutable map owner; choosing a fresh live replacement from side-known geometry is the later C43 interaction contract. The current owner is already available to direct commands through KnownProp.

**Verdict:** sound. **Confidence:** high for native/public-WASM red/green, chained ownership and original singleton preservation; actual rendered-frame verification remains a separate gate.

### Verify aggregate pixels through disposable production-path staging

**Choice:** Reuse the real garrison route/authority/decoder/renderer with labelled C00 asymmetric geometry and existing accepted house/ruin bundles. Falsify the old footprint and immediate-predecessor appearance owners separately, then restore every staged tracked byte.

**Gap:** The pre-aggregate loader cannot load a compound; the ordinary shipped scene cannot reach a two-generation held prototype. Its passing singleton checks alone cannot establish the new capability.

**Alternatives:** Ship another debug scenario/renderer hook, or claim the source/Node checks proved pixels. Both leave an unnecessary owner or inadequate evidence. Disposable staging exposes the actual changed frames without adding a production branch.

**Reach:** The saved complete observations/digests match across the isolated arms except the declared envelope fields; cameras/ticks/assets remain matched. The actual ring and terminal models change. Prototype roof/source fit, final art G0 and current-state picker design remain open. The team thread limit blocked a fresh visual agent, so screenshot-critique's explicit implementing-agent adversarial fallback is disclosed and root separately inspects the frames; no unprimed review is claimed.

**Verdict:** sound for focused capability evidence. **Confidence:** high for exact public states and visible ring/source-state differences; lower for broader appearance/scan acceptance, which remains deferred.
